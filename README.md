# Unsupervised_Capstone_Project

Project Summary -
* There were approximately 7787 records and 11 attributes in the dataset.

* We started by working on the missing values in the dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).

* Using the following attributes to create a cluster: cast, country, genre, director, rating, and description The TFIDF vectorizer was used to tokenize, preprocess, and vectorize the values in these attributes.

* The problem of dimensionality was dealt with through the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

* Using a variety of methods, including the elbow method, silhouette score, dendrogram, and others, we constructed two distinct types of clusters with the K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering algorithms, respectively, and determined the optimal number of clusters.

* The similarity matrix generated by applying cosine similarity was used to construct a content-based recommender system. The user will receive ten recommendations from this recommender system based on the type of show they watched.

Problem Statement:
Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of television shows and movies for viewers to watch at their convenience. With a monthly subscription, users have access to a vast library of content, including original series and films produced by Netflix. The platform also allows users to create multiple profiles, making it easy for family members or roommates to have their own personalized viewing experience. Additionally, Netflix allows users to download content to watch offline, making it a great option for those who travel frequently or have limited internet access. Overall, Netflix is a convenient and cost-effective way to access a wide variety of entertainment.

As of 2022-Q2, more than 220 million people had signed up for Netflix's online streaming service, making it the largest OTT provider worldwide. To improve the user experience and prevent subscriber churn, they must efficiently cluster the shows hosted on their platform.

By creating clusters, we will be able to comprehend the shows that are alike and different from one another. These clusters can be used to provide customers with individualized show recommendations based on their preferences.

This project aims to classify and group Netflix shows into specific clusters in such a way that shows in the same cluster are similar to one another and shows in different clusters are different.

Business Context:
Clustering Netflix movies and TV shows is crucial for enhancing user experience and optimizing business operations. It allows Netflix to improve content recommendations, streamline content acquisition and creation, fine-tune marketing strategies, and tailor offerings for specific user segments. By leveraging clustering analysis, Netflix can stay competitive, ensure content quality, and drive user engagement, ultimately leading to increased subscriber satisfaction and retention.

**Observation:**
* The United States-based movies and TV shows were produced most, followed by India and the United Kingdom.
* In India and the United States, a greater number of movies are present compared to TV shows.
* In the UK, Japan, and South Korea there are a greater number of TV shows than movies.

6. Column:'release_year'

Conclusion:
In this project, we tackled a text clustering problem in which we had to categorize and group Netflix shows into specific clusters in such a way that shows in the same cluster are similar to one another and shows in different clusters are not.

* There were approximately 7787 records and 11 attributes in the dataset.
* We started by working on the missing values in the dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* It was discovered that Netflix hosts more movies than television shows on its platform, and the total number of shows added to Netflix is expanding at an exponential rate. Additionally, most of the shows were made in the United States.
* The attributes were chosen as the basis for the **clustering of the data: cast, country, genre, director, rating, and description** The TFIDF vectorizer was used to tokenize, preprocess, and vectorize the values in these attributes.
* **10000 attributes** in total were created by **TFIDF vectorization**.
The problem of dimensionality was dealt with through the **use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Because 3000 components were able to account for more than 80% of the variance**, the total number of components was limited to 3000.
* Utilizing the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**, we first constructed clusters, and the **optimal number of clusters was determined to be 6**. The **elbow method and Silhouette score analysis** were used to get this.
* The **Agglomerative clustering algorithm** was then used to create clusters, and the **optimal number of clusters was determined to be 7**. This was obtained after visualizing the **dendrogram**.
* The similarity matrix generated by applying **cosine similarity** was used to construct a **content-based recommender system**. The user will receive ten recommendations from this recommender system based on the type of show they watched.
